## Welcome

Having hard times is fairly natural. We should not think about suicide, this is an ugly escape. Having thought of that and being serious about it, we humans are brothers and sisters ! And we are here to stand by each other.
Don't be shy ! Contact me and I will help.

### Background

I heard recently about a famous actor who committed suicide. And I loved the guy, he was kind in his roles (and probably in real life). But why ? Why didn't he talk to me ? I think I could had helped him. Sure I could. Sure you could too.

It's awful how there might be special 'legal' places to commit suicide ! Are we that cheap ?!
```

### Who am I ?
I'm just like you. No alien (in fact we all are). I have my own troubles. I can suspect where fundamentally all bad things lie. Regardless however.
let's talk if you insist on doing bad things !
My name is "Youssef".

### Am I out of business model ?
I don't want to be (at least not anymore). You will pay me (but later, and at your own pace). When you feel you are on the road to recovery, I want some big presents, maybe money, whatever suits you and whatever you wish to be generous about. 
I want 2 months of labor income (your best effort). And all that is decided when you feel yourself ready (not before); you decide when.

### Contact

WhatsApp me +96170853721 or gmail me diraniyoussef@gmail.com with the title "before suicide" (avoid any links so that it doesn't go to junk mail).
I prefer WhatsApp though; it's more reliable.
